# [Blockies](https://blockies.netlify.app/)

## What

Project for practicing newly aquired [react](https://reactjs.org), [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) [JIT](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode) skills. Mostly build for fun and learning purposes. The idea behind [Blockies](https://blockies.netlify.app/) is to create small web components that can be embedded in other websites or tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so).
